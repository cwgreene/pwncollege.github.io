# Module: x86 Assembly Refresher

This module serves as a refresher for x86 assembly, to prepare you for the rest of the course!

## Lectures

The following lectures have been upgraded from "Foundamentals" to this module's lectures.
They were due to be re-recorded for this run, but a brutal (non-COVID) illness prevented that.

- [Assembly Refresher: Computer Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jc0eSnrzF4) (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sVyPL92gbzg_it9aIeC-CjXtF2tpvAmZTKjWc-SlU0c/edit?usp=sharing))
