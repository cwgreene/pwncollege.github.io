# Welcome to pwn.college!

pwn.college is a first-stage education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion.
It is designed to take a "white belt" in cybersecurity to becoming a "blue belt", able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames.
The philosophy of pwn.college is "practice makes perfect".

pwn.college was created by [Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)](http://yancomm.net) and [kanak (Connor Nelson)](https://connornelson.com) at Arizona State University.
It powers ASU's Computer Systems Security course, CSE466, and is now open, for free, to participation for interested people around the world!

pwn.college is hosted across a number of internet services:
- **LECTURES:** We record our [lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/pwncollege) (for those that prefer offline versions, they are available on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/90838y3y45k7yvv/AACvZO2ej2_ri0oe4Jkl4GSBa?dl=0)).
- **OFFICE HOURS:** We stream our [classes on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege) during the fall semester, along with office hours and prerecorded lecture streams.
- **CHALLENGES:** We host [practice problems in our dojo](https://dojo.pwn.college).
- **DISCORD:** We collaborate on [discord](/discord)! **NOTE: if you are enrolled in ASU CSE466, please use the private link to join the discord so that you get assigned to the correct role!**
- **OPEN SOURCE:** We host our [open source stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/pwncollege).

**Stream Schedule from August through November (NOTE: PLEASE make sure to watch all available module videos before the Tuesday and Thursday streams!):**
- **TBD:** Module video stream (pre-recorded): weekly [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege).
- **Tuesday and Thursdays 4:30pm to 5:45pm:** Extended module Q&A, auxiliary lecturing, and collaborative problem solving (live): weekly [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege) and in ASU Murdock Lecture Hall room 201.
- **TBD:** Connor's office hours (live): weekly [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pwncollege).

All streams are open to THE WORLD! Want to ask voice questions? Come to ASU MUR-201.

# Who is this for? (prerequisites)

Consider hacking as a martial art.
Newcomers begin as _white belts_, with zero security knowledge.
Slowly and painfully, they become _yellow belts_, able to reason about simple security challenges and start down the road of, for example, CTF competitions.
Pushing even forward in that knowledge, understanding how to bypass mitigations and perform complex, multi-stage exploits, makes these students _blue belts_.
Over time, they become more sure in their skills, achieving _brown belt_ status (and able to, for example, contribute to the cybersecurity industry), before finally graduating to hacking masters: _black belts_.

pwn.college is meant for **white belts**.
If you already know the basics of hacking (and, thus, are a yellow belt), you will find this resource very easy.
If you are a brown belt, you will find it quite boring.
If you are a black belt, it will put you to sleep.

That being said, just because the material is for beginners does _not_ mean that the concepts are basic.
The course tackles complex concepts, up to and including the inner working of OS kernels.
Good Computer Organization and OS courses covering the following are recommended.
- C programming.
- C compilation.
- x86\_64 assembly.
- OS internals (system calls, etc).
- Linux operations (FS layout, permissions, shell scripting, etc).

Though pwn.college has an [introduction](modules/intro) module that covers some fundamentals, a lack of knowledge in these areas will lead to heavy difficulties in the course.

# How do I jump in?

pwn.college is organized as a set of modules covering different topics.
Each module has a set of lecture slides and videos and practice problems auto-generated for each aspiring hacker to practice on.
Challenges come in a _teaching_ variety, which will walk you through their own solutions, and a _testing_ variety, which will challenge you with less guidance.
Challenges are run directly on pwn.college, and can be launched in _practice_ mode, where you have root access but there is a fake flag, and _real_ mode, where you cannot read the flag without exploiting the challenge.

This year's modules will launch alongside the progress of ASU's Fall 2021 CSE466 class.
Modules will be launched on more or less a weekly basis!

**This year's modules** that have launched:

- [Module 0: Introduction](modules/intro)
- [Module 1: Program Interaction](modules/interaction)

**Last year's modules** are archived for the interested and impatient:

- [Module 1: Program Misuse](modules/suid)
- [Module 2: Shellcode](modules/shellcode)
- [Module 3: Sandboxing](modules/sandbox)
- [Module 4: Binary Reverse Engineering](modules/reversing)
- [Module 5: Memory Errors](modules/memory)
- [Module 6: Exploitation](modules/combo1)
- [Module 7: Return Oriented Programming](modules/rop)
- [Module 8: Kernel Introduction](modules/kernel)
- [Module 9: Dynamic Allocator Misuse](modules/heap)
- [Module 10: Race Conditions](modules/race)
- [Module 11: Advanced Exploitation](modules/combo2)
- [Module 12: Automatic Vulnerability Discovery](modules/auto)


# Earning Your Belts

This course turns hacker white belts into yellow belts and then refines them into blue belts.
This is not just metaphor: **we have actual belts**, in yellow and blue, custom-embroidered for pwn.college.

**How to earn a yellow belt?**
For a yellow belt, you must complete _all_ active challenges through Module 6 (Exploitation).

**How to earn a blue belt?**
For a blue belt, you must complete _all_ active challenges on pwn.college!

**How to get the actual belt?**
To get your belt, [send us an email](mailto:pwn-college@asu.edu) from the email address associated with your pwn.college account once you've completed the necessary challenges.
We'll then get your belt over to you!

**Who has gotten belts?**
We maintain a [list of hackers with pwn.college belts](belts).
Once you achieve your belt, if you provide your name, email address, and emoji, we will add you to the [list](belts)!

# Collaboration, Livestream, and Writeup Policy

The challenges created for pwn.college are educational material, and are used to grade CSE466 students at ASU.
Because of this, we would appreciate that writeups, walkthrough videos, and livestreams of challenge solutions are not posted to the internet.
Obviously, we can't enforce this, but we worked hard to make all of this public, and we would appreciate your help in keeping pwn.college a viable educational platform.

**Exceptions:** Really passionate about making walkthrough videos/streams/writeups?
We got you covered!
Feel free to do walkthroughs of:

- Program Misuse (Module 1): levels 1 and 2
- Shellcode (Module 2): levels 1 and 2
- Sandboxing (Module 3): levels 1 and 2
- Binary Reverse Engineering (Module 4): levels 1 and 2, and 14
- Memory Errors (Module 5): levels 1 and 2

If you email us a link to your video or writeup, we will link it from the relevant module page!

# Further Practice

After you learn the basics of cybersecurity and achieve yellow belt status, you should move on to harder challenges.

Capture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way.
The most popular way to find upcoming events is at [https://ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org).
There is also a list of introductory CTFs [here](https://zaratec.github.io/ctf-practice/).
If you are at ASU, feel free to check out and join ASU's CTF club _pwndevils_ at [https://pwndevils.com](https://pwndevils.com).

Wargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills.
Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based.
You can find a list of wargames at [https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus](https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus).

If you want to get involved with cybersecurity research, but don't know how, consider joining us for an [internship at ASU](https://sefcom.asu.edu/apprenticeship).
